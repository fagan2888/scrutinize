Scrutinize is an extensible misconfiguration scanner--not a vulnerability scanner, use Metasploit for that--written using Twisted. It checks for common misconfigurations such as allowing DNS Zone Transfer for your domain, not having a PTR record, or allowing read access to your configuration files.

Usage examples:
  ./domainscan patrickmylund.com
  ./hostscan patrickmylund.com

More information:
  ./domainscan -h
  ./hostscan -h

Extending:
  Write a module in checks/, then add that to the top of either hostscan.py or domainscan.py. (This process will be improved!)
